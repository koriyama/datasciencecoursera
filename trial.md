#Figure Out
As I type here, all I can see is raw unformatted text. The bottom of the screen is too shallow to see what may be present on this website in terms of what functionality I have with this raw unadulterated text. I can see, too, that this single line has no wrap applied to it. Can I change that later, I wonder?
Now I've found the wrap function and it calls itself 'Soft'. I suppose that a hard version would be too hard to find.
##List trial
Now, let's try out a list.
*I love mango
*a juicy, wet mango
*and cherries
*just give me your cherries
##And to infinity
I wonder how many level headers this system has. In these lines, I'll increase the number of hashes to pound out the question.
###I'm feeling a little third tonight
####On the Forth road bridge he doesn't jump
#####Hey Ho Fyvie 'O
######I have a sixth sense that this isn't going to work
#######I'd be in seventh heaven if it did
########Aw, he's gone and ate up my confidence
<b>STOP<\b>
